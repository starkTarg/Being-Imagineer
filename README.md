# Being-Imagineer

Sample code of the questions

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Description
* I tried to represent the main OOPS(**Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Poly-morphism**) features in each of the question.
* I also tried to use other OOPS features that comes with java (static, final, etc.)
* I have written description for each method/member.
* This time I have written differently from how I did at HackerRank last time.Hackerrank has restriction to one file.
  Though I tried to use object oriented principle that time as well.
* I also tried to kept the methods modular and readable.
* **I have not used any object oriented design principle**. I felt it is out of scope of the current assignment.
* There is no unit test written.
